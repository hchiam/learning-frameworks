# Learning frameworks

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Practice creating a simple notepad app in 5 different frameworks (try using [Yeoman generators](https://yeoman.io/generators/), kinda like [generator-hchiam-learning](https://github.com/hchiam/generator-hchiam-learning)):

```bash
yarn global add yo
```

[Angular](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-angular)

[Closure](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-closure)

[Backbone](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-backbone)

[React](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-reactjs)
