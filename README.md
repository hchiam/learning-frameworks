# Learning frameworks

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Practice creating a simple notepad app in 5 different frameworks (try using [Yeoman generators](https://yeoman.io/generators/), kinda like [generator-hchiam-learning](https://github.com/hchiam/generator-hchiam-learning)):

```bash
yarn global add yo
yarn global add grunt-cli
yarn global add bower
```
